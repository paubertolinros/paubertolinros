The more I learn, the more Iâ€™ll be extending this list by adding new skills that I canâ€™t wait to discover. What I know for now is that I have found on web development, the tools, set of skills, and strategies that require for me to grow both personally and professionally. 
By achieving that, my ultimate goal is to direct my work to projects and actions that will help making of this world a better place.
